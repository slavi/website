      <br />
      <br />
One of the goals of the Aleksander Foundation is to help University students develop their CV 
writing and presentation skills. Having a well written CV will significantly enhance your chances 
when applying for various competitions, but more importantly - for job positions. Therefore we want 
to share with you our thoughts of how a good CV should be organised and what it should contain. 
Attached is just an example; however it is a highly successful one.

	  A couple of important points: 
<div id="listFixer" style="top:0;left:25px;width:500px;" align="left">
<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="The Aleksander Foundation" />&nbsp;&nbsp;CV should be no more than 1 page
<br />
<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="The Aleksander Foundation" />&nbsp;&nbsp;CV should be clear to read
<br />
<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="The Aleksander Foundation" />&nbsp;&nbsp;CV should not be a description of the whole life, but just most relevant things
<br />
<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="The Aleksander Foundation" />&nbsp;&nbsp;CV should not include elementary school and secondary school
<br />
<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="The Aleksander Foundation" />&nbsp;&nbsp;CV should be personal – do not use standardized forms, your final judgment is what matters most
<br />
<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="The Aleksander Foundation" />&nbsp;&nbsp;CV should NOT contain photograph 
<br />
<img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="The Aleksander Foundation" />&nbsp;&nbsp;CV should use “Action verbs” – prepared, presented, organized, analysed, managed. There are numerous web sites providing action verbs classified into categories

A good CV once written is just the platform that you should start building on. As you are 
progressing through your education, and starting your career you should be focused in engaging 
in CV enhancing activities. Examples include: taking specialised quantitative courses, completing 
projects that have connection to the real economy and industry, learning foreign languages, using 
statistical and various other specialised computer packages, applying for internships in your summer 
and winter breaks, pursuing own projects and investment ideas parallel to studying. 
<br />
<br />
The CV is the single, most important 1 page piece of marketing you have - use it wisely.
<br />
<br />
<b>Good luck!</b>
